mobiusdb
========

MobiusDB is a single-host, non-distributed data store focused on infinite MELT (metrics, events, logs, tracings) data. It is built to append time-overlapping data forever while enabling efficient storage and query of high-volume observability streams.

## MELT data focus

See the MELT deep research and planning documents:
- [MELT data characteristics](docs/melt_characteristics.md)
- [MELT architecture proposal](docs/melt_architecture.md)
- [MELT development roadmap](docs/melt_roadmap.md)
